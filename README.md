### Names: Mia Chen
**1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?**
Within a Github action that runs whenever the code is pushed. Automation testing are where scripts are written to automatically test software based on certain events, such as code getting pushed to a remote repository. Here, Github action is a tool that can ensure any new code that is pushed to the repo must pass the automated tests before it can be merged with main. 

**2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)**
No, unit testing would be more suitable for this.
